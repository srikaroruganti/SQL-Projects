# SQL Projects Repository

Welcome to my SQL projects repository! This collection showcases my proficiency in SQL through two distinct projects: "Data Cleaning using SQL" and "Data Exploration using SQL."

## Project 1: Data Cleaning using SQL

### Description
In this project, I tackled the task of data cleaning within the Nashville Housing dataset. The goal was to prepare the data for analysis by standardizing date formats, filling in missing property addresses, and breaking down address information into individual columns. I also improved data quality by converting "Y" and "N" values to "Yes" and "No" in the "Sold as Vacant" field. Lastly, I removed duplicate records and unnecessary columns to create a cleaner and more structured dataset.

## Project 2: Data Exploration using SQL

### Description
The second project delves into the realm of data exploration using SQL, focusing on COVID-19 data analysis. I employed a variety of SQL techniques, including joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), temporary tables, and aggregate functions, to extract valuable insights. The exploration covered aspects such as total cases versus total deaths, population percentages affected by the virus, countries with the highest infection and death rates concerning their populations, and detailed global COVID-19 statistics. Additionally, I created a view to store data for future visualization and analysis.

These two projects collectively demonstrate my SQL skills in both data preparation and in-depth exploration, showcasing my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights.

Feel free to explore each project for detailed code snippets and further insights. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
